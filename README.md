# Spam Classification using Machine Learning 

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to classify spam and ham (legitimate) messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. By analyzing patterns in text messages, we build models that automatically detect fraudulent emails and SMS messages.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization for word importance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Data Visualization**: Word clouds and spam frequency analysis.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-classifier.git
   cd spam-classifier
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Datavisualization.ipynb
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset consists of SMS messages labeled as "spam" or "ham." It is preprocessed to enhance model accuracy.

## Usage
- Explore the dataset and visualize spam trends.
- Train different ML models to classify messages.
- Evaluate the models and improve classification performance.

## Results
The Naïve Bayes classifier performed best in terms of precision, efficiently detecting spam with minimal false positives.
